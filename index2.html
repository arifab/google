<ol style="width: 80%; margin: auto;">
<li>
    <p><strong>Q: What do I get now that I’m a member?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Startup Launch has tiered membership levels. At the “Start” tier, we help entrepreneurs build their products with Cloud Credits, and create online content to help them improve their products. Startups at later stages (see next question) are invited for further mentoring and UX reviews. You can read more about the offers in the Program Benefits section here. 
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p><strong>Q: How do you select members and tiers? </strong></p>
    <p>A: Startup Launch selects technology-focused startups based on their ability to articulate their product idea. Successful applications can be at any stage, but must answer the question: what problem does your product solve? We then diversify across industry and geography. From this list, Startups are selected into the the “Build” and “Grow” tiers based  on participation in our events and communities, nominations from other Googlers, and demonstrated traction (such as number of downloads or users). 
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p><strong>Q: Can I apply my Cloud Credits to Wallet, Maps, Playstore, or AdWords?</strong></p>
    <p>A: No. The Cloud Credits can be applied toward Cloud billing only. </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p><strong>Q: What other product offers do you have?</strong></p>
    <p>A: We’re rolling out other product offerings based on interest and uptake. Drop us a line at <a href=”mailto:startuplaunch@google.com”>startuplaunch@google.com</a> if you have an idea of what product offerings could be useful.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <p><strong>Q: Is this the same as the $100K Cloud offer? </strong></p>
    <p>A: Yes. The $100K <a href="https://cloud.google.com/developers/startups/">Cloud Credit</a> is currently being offered through partner programs and is available to our “Build” and “Grow” tier startups.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <p><strong>Q: If I am accepted to Startup Launch program does this means I am accepted to Launchpad?</strong></p>
    <p>A: No. Launchpad events run globally throughout the year, and members of the Startup Launch program, together with our partner programs, will be considered based on geography. Selected startups will be invited to provide a bit more detail about their technologies and teams before final invitations are sent.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <p><strong>Q: How do I get more out of this program?</strong></p>
    <p>A: If you’re interested in the mentorship, UX reviews, or meeting other members, we encourage you to attend GBG and GDG events in your area. We’ll also e-mail you invitations throughout the year based on your location and areas of interest - in the meantime, keep in touch via our online community at G+ g.co/launchplus.</p>
